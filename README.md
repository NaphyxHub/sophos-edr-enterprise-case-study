# Enterprise EDR Case Study — Sophos Central (Zero Trust)

Hands-on EDR case study completed in an Oak Academy training lab environment.

## What I practiced
- Policy engineering (custom policies — no default Base)
- Validation testing and evidence collection (events/logs/reports)
- Basic incident response workflow (manual endpoint isolation)
- Visibility checks using Live Discover Query Library

## Controls configured & tested
- Threat Protection (malware + ransomware)
- Web Control (Gambling / Social / P2P categories)
- Application Control (TeamViewer & uTorrent)
- DLP (pattern-based web upload blocking for sensitive data)
- EICAR simulation (observed detect → block → clean behavior)
- Monitor mode (visibility via events/logs)
- Live Discover Query Library checks (network-active processes + startup registry)
- Reporting (Live Discover notes + Weekly Web Control report)
